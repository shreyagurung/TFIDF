The new milk chocolate was introduced to the British market in 1905 and, with its unique flavour and texture, quickly became the market leader.
Milk chocolate was first made by Cadbury in 1897 by blending milk powder with the basic chocolate ingredients of cocoa butter, cocoa mass and sugar. By today's standards the chocolate wasn't particularly good - it was very coarse and dry and neither sweet nor milky enough.
At that time, the Swiss dominate the milk chocolate market with a product of superior taste and texture produced by Daniel Peters of Vevey, using condensed milk rather than milk powder.
In the early 1900s, George Cadbury Junior and experts at Bournville took on the Swiss, researching new recipes and production methods.
By June 1904, the recipe was perfected and a delicious rich and creamy new milk chocolate was ready for production.
Launched in 1905, Cadbury proudly boasted that its new milk chocolate was not only "as good as," but better than the European milk chocolate. With its now-famous glass and a half of full-cream milk in every 200gms, it contained far more milk than any previously known chocolate.
The special flavours produced when fresh milk, cocoa mass and sugar are cooked together in the first stages of the chocolate crumb making process give Cadbury Dairy Milk its unique taste.
While advertising and packaging designs have evolved over the years, along with considerable technological advances in production, the Cadbury Dairy Milk recipe is still basically the same as it was in 1905.
Cadbury Dairy Milk blocks comes in a range of sizes suitable for all ages and occasions - from a quick snack, a self-indulgent treat, something to share with family or friends or a gift.
Cadbury Dairy Milk is sold with a similar design worldwide - the centerpiece of all packaging is the iconic "glass and a half " image showing the famous glass and a half of pure full cream milk flowing into a delicious chunk of Cadbury Dairy Milk chocolate.
